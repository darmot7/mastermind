To use the test methods, make sure you comment out lines 101 and 102 of master_mind_app.rb

Have a wonderful day!

TO-DO:

1.There are MANY optimizations available in this code. For example, sometimes I'll call array.count(3) multiple times in a method. I believe ruby actually counts each time the method is called and to make the app take less time to run I should limit these extra method calls. These redundancies are purely a function of building this app while learning Ruby for the first time.
