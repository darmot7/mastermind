To run this application cd to the dir you have master_mind.app.rb and type "ruby master_mind_app.rb" 

There is a sneaky bug in this app. About 6% of the time I have to reset all_permutations and I am unsure as to why I have to do it. My algorithm is solid but there must be a bug that I am not aware of in my implementation. I am working on it. With the fix in place, it runs 100% of the time.
